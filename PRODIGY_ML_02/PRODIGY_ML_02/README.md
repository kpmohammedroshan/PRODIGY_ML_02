# Customer Segmentation using K-means Clustering

This project is part of my internship at **Prodigy Infotech**. In Task-02, I developed a K-means clustering algorithm to segment customers of a retail store based on their purchase history. The main objective of this project is to identify distinct groups of customers to enable targeted marketing strategies.

## 📂 Project Overview

- **Task Name:** Customer Segmentation using K-means Clustering
- **Objective:** Group customers based on their purchase behavior to identify unique segments.
- **Dataset:** [Customer Segmentation Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python) from Kaggle.
- **Tools & Libraries:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 🔍 Project Details

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Imported and explored the dataset to understand its structure and features.
- Selected relevant features (`Annual Income`, `Spending Score`) for clustering.
- Standardized the data to ensure effective clustering.

### 2. Implementing K-means Clustering
- Applied the K-means algorithm with a range of cluster numbers to identify optimal clusters.
- Used the Elbow method to determine the best value for `k`.

### 3. Visualization & Analysis
- Visualized the resulting clusters using scatter plots to gain insights into customer behavior.
- Analyzed the characteristics of each cluster to understand customer segments.

## 📊 Key Findings
- Identified distinct customer groups based on their annual income and spending score.
- Insights can be used for personalized marketing and targeted promotional strategies.


4. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to see the analysis and visualizations.

## 🔧 Future Work
- Extend the analysis by including additional features like customer demographics.
- Explore other clustering techniques like hierarchical clustering.
